# Hackathon

We started to explore the data and we found that some reviewers had very minimal word clouds.
That lead us to believe that some reviews are bot reviewers.
We created a criteria to identify these bot reviewers. 
We came to find a few reviewers that were bots by looking at only 5 star reviews, non verified purchases and reviews that were less than 5 words.
Also as we explored our data we ran into a user who has left 791 reviews over the span of 16 years. 
We managed to track his activity over the years and what we discovered was shocking.
